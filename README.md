My C programming package (EZ.ZIP): Includes EZ library, examples, tutorial,
graphics (fonts, icons), TinyCC, Notepad++. 100% FREE. See preview.jpg.

EZ C LIBRARY. Written by Mysterious Software. Just
a preview of my programming with minimal examples
of how to use the library.

* Easiest C programming package/library for TinyCC
* Examples. Easy one-click (NAME.BAT) to compile+run.
* All the essentials needed to create programs, games,
graphics demonstrations.
* Library functions use the simplest most logical names -
load_image, draw_image, open_file, save_file, load_font,
text_copy, draw_text, draw_gradient. Draws everything from
scratch without using OS
* Tutorial: Introduction to C (See \HELP\INDEX.HTML)
* Includes custom graphics, fonts and icons (\MEDIA\). Portable
algorithms for any system. Every single pixel, line, image, font,
etc, is drawn directly to memory using only CPU instructions
and no OS specific graphics
* For TinyCC, the smallest fully featured C compiler. Many
times faster than other compilers. VC++ disadvantages:
Big (gigabytes!), wasteful, slow compile/build, bloated
executables, setup takes forever.

SETUP

See \BINARY\ for TinyCC and Notepad++. Just copy
\BINARY\TCC\ folder to: C:\ (C:\TCC\TCC.EXE).
